/*
 Count of Occurrences
 Could you write a function that lists the number of occurrences for each word in descending
 order? For the output, assume your solution makes use of a standard Swift Dictionary or Array of tuple values.
 Also assume your algorithm does not make use of any built-in Swift sorting functions.
 input:
 this is a test of the emergency broadcast system this is only a test dog dog dog
 output:
 dog 3
 a 2
 is 2
 test 2
 this 2
 broadcast 1
 emergency 1
 of 1
 only 1
 the 1
 system 1
 At first glance, this challenge seems relatively straightforward.
 The idea being one could easily iterate through a list of words in O(n) â€” linear time and track the number of word
 occurrences with a standard dictionary. However, difficulty is introduced when sorting the word list.
 Without using a built-in function, how would you keep the list sorted as new items are being added?
